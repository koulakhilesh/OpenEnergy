<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

<!-- [![OpenEnergy Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com) -->

OpenEnergy is a dynamic simulation platform designed for modeling and analyzing energy markets and renewable energy systems. This project aims to bridge the gap between energy engineering and data science, providing a comprehensive tool for understanding and optimizing energy storage and market operations.

Why OpenEnergy stands out:
* **Innovative Approach**: Combines advanced algorithms and data analysis to simulate energy market dynamics and battery operations.
* **User-Centric Design**: Intuitive and easy-to-use, enabling users to focus on analysis and insights rather than complex setup processes.
* **Adaptable and Scalable**: Whether you are a researcher, industry professional, or enthusiast, OpenEnergy is built to adapt to a wide range of use cases and scales as needed.

As the energy landscape evolves, OpenEnergy will continue to grow, adding new features and capabilities. Your feedback and contributions are welcome to make this tool even more versatile and powerful.

## Built With

This project is built with a combination of powerful Python libraries, each playing a crucial role in the functionality of OpenEnergy. Here's a list of the major libraries used:

* [Python](https://www.python.org/) - The core programming language
* [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) - Data manipulation and analysis
* [NumPy](https://numpy.org/) - Support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices
* [Pyomo](https://www.pyomo.org/) - Linear programming optimization library

These tools collectively enable efficient data handling, optimization problem solving, progress tracking, and robust testing, making OpenEnergy a reliable and scalable solution.

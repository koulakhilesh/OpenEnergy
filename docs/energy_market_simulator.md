# Energy Market Simulator Documentation

This Python code defines an energy market simulator that uses a battery optimization scheduler to determine the optimal charging and discharging schedule for a battery, and then calculates the profit and loss (P&L) from following this schedule.

## Classes

The code defines two main classes:

- `PnLCalculator`: This class calculates the P&L from a given battery schedule and actual electricity prices.

- `EnergyMarketSimulator`: This class simulates the operation of the battery over a given date range, using a given price model to generate electricity prices, a `BatteryOptimizationScheduler` to create the battery schedule, and a `PnLCalculator` to calculate the P&L.

## Mathematical Model

The P&L is calculated as follows:

```latex
\text{{pnl}} = \sum_{i=0}^{n} \left( \text{{value}} \times \text{{price}} \times \text{{efficiency}} \right)
```

where:
- `n` is the number of time intervals.
- `value` is the amount of energy charged or discharged at time `i`.
- `price` is the electricity price at time `i`.
- `efficiency` is the charging or discharging efficiency of the battery.

If the battery is charging, the P&L is decreased by the cost of charging the battery. If the battery is discharging, the P&L is increased by the revenue from discharging the battery.

## Methods

The `EnergyMarketSimulator` class has several methods:

- `process_daily_schedule`: This method processes a daily battery schedule by charging or discharging the battery according to the schedule.

- `run_daily_operation`: This method runs the daily operation of the battery. It creates a battery schedule using the given prices, processes the schedule, and calculates the P&L.

- `simulate`: This method simulates the operation of the battery over the given date range. It generates electricity prices for each day, runs the daily operation of the battery, and accumulates the total P&L. It returns a list of results for each day.

## Usage

To use the `EnergyMarketSimulator`, you need to provide a `Battery`, a price model that implements the `IPriceData` interface, a `PnLCalculator`, and a `BatteryOptimizationScheduler`. You can then call the `simulate` method to run the simulation and get the results.

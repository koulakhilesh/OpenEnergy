# Documentation for battery.py

This Python module, `battery.py`, contains classes and methods for simulating a battery's behavior, including its efficiency adjustment due to temperature, state of health (SOH) calculation, and charging and discharging operations.

## Classes

### 1. TemperatureEfficiencyAdjuster

This class adjusts the efficiency of the battery based on the temperature. It implements the `IEfficiencyAdjuster` interface.

#### Method: adjust_efficiency

This method adjusts the charge and discharge efficiency of the battery based on the temperature. The temperature effect is calculated as the absolute difference between the current temperature and 25 degrees Celsius, multiplied by 0.01.

The new charge and discharge efficiencies are calculated as follows:

$$
\text{{new\_charge\_efficiency}} = \max(0.5, \min(\text{{charge\_efficiency}} - \text{{temp\_effect}}, 1.0))
$$

$$
\text{{new\_discharge\_efficiency}} = \max(0.5, \min(\text{{discharge\_efficiency}} - \text{{temp\_effect}}, 1.0))
$$

### 2. BasicSOHCalculator

This class calculates the state of health (SOH) of the battery. It implements the `ISOHCalculator` interface.

#### Method: calculate_soh

This method calculates the new SOH based on the current SOH, the energy cycled, and the depth of discharge (DOD). The degradation rate is calculated as the base degradation (0.000005) multiplied by the energy cycled and the DOD factor (which is 2 if DOD > 0.5, else 1).

The new SOH is calculated as follows:

$$
\text{{new\_soh}} = \text{{soh}} \times (1 - \text{{degradation\_rate}})
$$

### 3. Battery

This class represents a battery with various properties and methods to simulate its behavior.

#### Method: validate_initial_conditions

This method validates the initial conditions of the battery. It checks if the capacity is greater than 0, and if the initial SOC and SOH are between 0 and 1.

#### Method: adjust_efficiency_for_temperature

This method adjusts the charge and discharge efficiency of the battery for the current temperature.

#### Method: charge

This method charges the battery with a given amount of energy. It first adjusts the efficiency for the current temperature, then calculates the actual energy added to the battery considering the charge efficiency. It updates the state of charge (SOC) and calls the method to update the SOH and cycles.

The actual energy added to the battery is calculated as follows:

$$
\text{{actual\_energy\_mwh}} = \text{{energy\_mwh}} \times \text{{charge\_efficiency}}
$$

The new SOC is calculated as follows:

$$
\text{{new\_soc}} = \min(\text{{soc}} + \frac{\text{{actual\_energy\_mwh}}}{\text{{capacity\_mwh}}}, 1.0)
$$

#### Method: discharge

This method discharges the battery with a given amount of energy. It first adjusts the efficiency for the current temperature, then calculates the actual energy removed from the battery considering the discharge efficiency. It updates the SOC and calls the method to update the SOH and cycles.

The actual energy removed from the battery is calculated as follows:

$$
\text{{actual\_energy\_mwh}} = \text{{energy\_mwh}} \times \text{{discharge\_efficiency}}
$$

The new SOC is calculated as follows:

$$
\text{{new\_soc}} = \max(\text{{soc}} - \frac{\text{{actual\_energy\_mwh}}}{\text{{capacity\_mwh}}}, 0.0)
$$

#### Method: update_soh_and_cycles

This method updates the SOH and cycles of the battery. It adds the energy cycled to the total energy cycled, calculates the depth of discharge (DOD), updates the SOH, and checks and updates the cycles.

The new energy cycled is calculated as follows:

$$
\text{{new\_energy\_cycled\_mwh}} = \text{{energy\_cycled\_mwh}} + \text{{energy\_mwh}}
$$

The DOD is calculated as follows:

$$
\text{{dod}} = 1.0 - \text{{soc}}
$$

#### Method: check_and_update_cycles

This method checks and updates the cycles of the battery. It calculates the cycles as the total energy cycled divided by twice the capacity of the battery, and adds this to the cycle count.

The cycles are calculated as follows:

$$
\text{{cycles}} = \frac{\text{{energy\_cycled\_mwh}}}{2 \times \text{{capacity\_mwh}}}
$$

The new cycle count is calculated as follows:

$$
\text{{new\_cycle\_count}} = \text{{cycle\_count}} + \text{{cycles}}
$$
